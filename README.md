# Adaptation in a Serial-Dilution Co-culture

A consumer-resource modeling framework in a serial-dilution setup, where $m$ species compete for $p$ nutrients in a series of batches. At each batch, a nutrient mixture with a fixed composition $\lbrace c_i(t=0)\rbrace_{i=1}^p$ and total amount $c_0=\sum_i c_i(0)$. Similarly, a mixture of species $\lbrace\rho_\sigma(t=0)\rbrace_{sigma=1}^m$ is added, with a fixed total amount $\rho_0=\sum_\sigma \rho_\sigma(0)$.
